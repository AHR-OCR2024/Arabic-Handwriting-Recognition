## Introduction
Arabic Handwriting Recognition is a project aimed at developing a robust system to accurately recognize and digitize Arabic handwritten text. This repository groups together all the scripts, models, and datasets used throughout the development process.

## Features
- **High Accuracy**: Utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms to ensure high recognition accuracy.
- **Customizable Models**: Easy to retrain and fine-tune models on new datasets.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple interface for testing and utilizing the OCR system.
- **Extensive Dataset**: Includes a comprehensive dataset of Arabic handwritten text.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AHR-OCR2024/Arabic-Handwriting-Recognition.git
cd Arabic-Handwriting-Recognition/Application
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm i
```

Download the pretrained models from here (upload in progress)

## Usage
To use the OCR system, follow these steps:
1. **Prepare the data**: Ensure your data is in the correct format.
2. **Train the model**: Use the provided training scripts to train the OCR model.
3. **Evaluate**: Test the model on a validation set to check its accuracy.
4. **Run predictions**: Use the trained model to recognize text from new handwritten samples.

To Run the application, run each of these commands in a separate terminial

```bash
python ./Backend/Backend.py
npm run dev
```

## Data
The dataset used in this project is included in the repository. It contains a variety of Arabic handwritten samples to train and evaluate the model. To use the dataset:
1. Download the `Data.rar` file.
2. Extract the contents to the appropriate directory.

## Preprocessing
Preprocessing is a critical stage in the development of our Arabic handwriting recognition system. The goal is to enhance the quality of the input data to ensure accurate recognition. Here are the main steps involved in our preprocessing pipeline:

1. **Image Acquisition**: We collect images of handwritten Arabic text from various sources, including scanned documents and photos taken by digital cameras.

   </p>

2. **Geometric Correction**: We correct distortions and warping in the images. Techniques like Hough Line Transform and DocTr (Document Image Transformer) are used to straighten the text lines.

3. **Noise Removal**: We apply filters to remove noise and enhance the clarity of the text. This includes techniques like Gaussian blur and median filtering.

   </p>
   *Unwarped and filtered image*

5. **Segmentation**: We segment the images into paragraphs, lines, and individual characters. This involves methods like histogram projection and CRAFT (Character Region Awareness for Text Detection).

   </p>
   *Segmented text using CRAFT*

7. **Normalization**: We normalize the images to a fixed size (64x64) and rescale the pixel values to the range [0, 1] by dividing by 255.0.

## AI Training

The AI training phase involves developing and training deep learning models to recognize and digitize handwritten Arabic text. Here are the key components of our AI training process:

<p align="center"><strong>1. Prototype Model Experimentation:</strong></p>
We experimented with three different architectures on a small portion of the data (15,477 Samples) at first to identify the most effective model for our Arabic handwriting recognition system. The comparison of the results is shown in the table below:

| Architecture   | CER  | Accuracy |
|----------------|------|----------|
| EfficientNet-B1| 7.3% | 92.7%    |
| VGG19          | 5.4% | 94.6%    |
| ResNet152      | 2.96%| 97.04%   |

</p>

<p align="center"><strong>2. Dataset Preparation:</strong></p>
We use a combination of the Arabic Alphabet Character dataset and the KHATT dataset. The combined final dataset includes 108,619 samples.

<p align="center"><strong>3. Data Augmentation:</strong></p>
To improve the robustness of our model, we apply various data augmentation techniques, such as rotation, translation, and scaling.

<p align="center"><strong>4. Model Architecture:</strong></p>
We utilize the ResNet50V2 model, pre-trained on the Arabic Alphabet Character dataset. We then continue training on the KHATT dataset using advanced techniques.

<p align="center"><strong>5. Training Techniques:</strong></p>
- **Optimizer**: We use the Adam optimizer with specific parameters for efficient training.
- **Learning Rate Scheduler**: A cosine learning rate scheduler is employed to adjust the learning rate dynamically during training.
- **Training Duration**: The model is trained across 70 epochs to ensure convergence and optimal performance.

<p align="center"><strong>6. Evaluation Metrics:</strong></p>
We use Character Error Rate (CER) and accuracy as our primary evaluation metrics. Our final model achieved a CER of 3% and an accuracy of 97% on the test set.
