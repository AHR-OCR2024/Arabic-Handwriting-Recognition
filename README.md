## Introduction
Arabic Handwriting Recognition is a project aimed at developing a robust system to accurately recognize and digitize Arabic handwritten text. This repository groups together all the scripts, models, and datasets used throughout the development process.

## Features
- **High Accuracy**: Utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms to ensure high recognition accuracy.
- **Customizable Models**: Easy to retrain and fine-tune models on new datasets.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple interface for testing and utilizing the OCR system.
- **Extensive Dataset**: Includes a comprehensive dataset of Arabic handwritten text.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AHR-OCR2024/Arabic-Handwriting-Recognition.git
cd Arabic-Handwriting-Recognition/Application
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm i
```

Download the pretrained models from here (upload in progress)

## Usage
To use the OCR system, follow these steps:
1. **Prepare the data**: Ensure your data is in the correct format.
2. **Train the model**: Use the provided training scripts to train the OCR model.
3. **Evaluate**: Test the model on a validation set to check its accuracy.
4. **Run predictions**: Use the trained model to recognize text from new handwritten samples.

To Run the application, run each of these commands in a separate terminial

```bash
python ./Backend/Backend.py
npm run dev
```

## Data
The dataset used in this project is included in the repository. It contains a variety of Arabic handwritten samples to train and evaluate the model. To use the dataset:
1. Download the `Data.rar` file.
2. Extract the contents to the appropriate directory.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps to contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
